# React Demo Scaffolding
> âš  In 4.18, the API will be supporting native ES modules ([currently in Beta](https://github.com/Esri/feedback-js-api-next/tree/master/esm-samples)). Moving forward, this will be my go-to method. Here's the [CRA sample](https://github.com/Esri/feedback-js-api-next/tree/master/esm-samples/jsapi-create-react-app).

I use React for most "big" demoes -> there are two approaches to building React apps with the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) -> the one I use generally depends on the day -> so here are two options!

* [`arcgis-webpack-plugin`](/arcgis-webpack-plugin): scaffolding using [`@arcgis/webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-webpack-plugin)
* [`esri-loader`](/esri-loader): scaffolding using [`esri-loader`](https://github.com/Esri/esri-loader)
