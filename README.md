# React Demo Scaffolding

> React scaffolding for demo projects

I use React for most "big" demoes -> there are two approaches to building React apps with the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) -> the one I use generally depends on the day -> so here are two options:

* [`arcgis-webpack-plugin`](/arcgis-webpack-plugin): scaffolding using [`@arcgis/webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-webpack-plugin)
* [`esri-loader`](/esri-loader): scaffolding using [`esri-loader`](https://github.com/Esri/esri-loader)
